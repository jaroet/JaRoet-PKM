# JaRoet PKM Documentation

**JaRoet PKM** is a local-first, keyboard-centric personal knowledge management system designed for speed and fluidity. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that use folders, JaRoet uses a **Topological** approach. Notes are organized by their relationships to one another (Parents, Children, Siblings, Related), allowing you to traverse your knowledge graph naturally.

## Table of Contents

*   **[Interface Guide](./interface.md)**: An overview of the main screen, top bar, and status bar.
*   **[Keyboard Shortcuts](./shortcuts.md)**: A comprehensive list of all keyboard shortcuts for navigation, editing, and organization.
*   **[Core Features](./features.md)**: Detailed explanations of major features like Journaling, Linking, Mentions, and Markdown.
*   **[Settings & Configuration](./settings.md)**: A guide to customizing the application, managing vaults, and setting up themes.

## Standalone Tools
The release includes `obsidian_to_jaroet.html`, a tool to convert an Obsidian Vault folder into a JSON file compatible with JaRoet's "Merge" import. It preserves folder structures and converts journal entries to the JaRoet ISO format.
