# ✨ Features Overview

JaRoet PKM is packed with features designed to help you think, write, and organize without friction.

## 🧠 Topological Linking
Instead of folders, notes are organized by their relationships. This allows you to build a web of knowledge that reflects how you think. The main interface shows you the local "topology" of any given note:
*   **Parents**: Higher-level concepts.
*   **Children**: Details and sub-notes.
*   **Siblings**: Related notes sharing the same parent.
*   **Related**: Lateral connections.

## 📅 Chronological Journaling
Press `Ctrl + J` to instantly jump to today's note.

*   **Automatic Hierarchy**: Creates `Year > Month > Day` structure automatically.
*   **Time Travel**: "Today" links to "Yesterday" for sequential reading.
*   **On This Day**: See what you wrote on this specific date in previous years.
