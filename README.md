# JaRoet PKM

**JaRoet PKM** is a fast, local-first Personal Knowledge Management tool designed for keyboard power users. It moves away from traditional folder structures, organizing your notes based on their relationships (Parents, Children, Siblings, and Related items). This creates a natural "topology" of thought that you can navigate fluidly.

## Key Features

*   **Topological Navigation:** Browse notes based on context—what links to it, what it links to, and what is related.
*   **Keyboard-Centric:** Navigate, link, unlink, edit, and reorganize your graph without touching the mouse.
*   **Local & Private:** All data is stored locally in your browser (IndexedDB). Nothing is sent to the cloud.
*   **Markdown Support:** Full editor with preview support.
*   **Journaling Engine:** Automated daily note creation with historical linking ("On This Day") and sequential navigation.
*   **Single File App:** The entire application runs from a single HTML file.
